Q:Within Js what is event propagation and what are the two types.

A:Event propagation is the propagation of events. However what I think you are looking for is looking for an event listener. Which is when you define an event that
looks for an event to happen and then executes a fuction. For example we can set up an event for a button which could be on click which looks for  the button to a 
clicked which once clicked would run a fuction we have written in JS which will print "Hooray!"

-When talking about bubbling and caputing: One goes from top to bottom and the other goes from bottom to top. For an example if you were to have a burger and talk about how you
 want your meat cooked raw -> rare > medium rare etc, etc. If you did bubbling it would go in to out so medium rare > rare > raw and capturing would be out to in raw > rare > medium rare.
  S: Jeremy was looking for Bubbling / capturing but David went into setting up Event Listening.

Q:Name within JS name a few different types of functions and describe them

A:The one we are most familar with is console.log which prints the specified information to the console. ....(Blanks for a bit when told Console.log() was more so a method).. 
let's see some other functions . . . . (blank)... I know of callback functions are if you didn't implement a function already and you want to implement the function later 
but another function needs it you can pass it in but define it later.
  S:I got a little lost following some of these answers. David seems to not yet fully understand the different functions in JS and how they function / their syntax.

Q:What is normalization and what are the three types?

A:There are 3 types n123. N1 ..uhh... I know n2n3 one of them either has transatives dependancies and I think n3 has no dependancies. Normalization is reducing your 
tables to the simplist forms they can be.
  S:Had the basics of the forms but wasn't sure on which form was what.
