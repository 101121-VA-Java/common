Yesterday: I studied the notes of the day. I completed some work in the backend and added some models. I attempted to do some User tests- I wasn’t successful. I tried to do the log4j. I also created the html for managers, employees and added some css.  
Today: I am going to try to add the driver for the backend and javelin to the project. Also get some help with tests and log4j. Later I will review the material and try to do a lesson in codecademy in js.
