Blockers: need to study up on Javalin to fully grasp how its going to interact with the fronend.

What did I do yesterday
    Yesterday I worked on the front end a bit, HTML and CSS with bootstrap, then I went on to community building up on the back end by creating a Dao and service layer for reimbursement.
What am I working on today
