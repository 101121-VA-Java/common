    Front end foundation is pretty solid, needs to add javascript functionality for linkage, not tottaly confident in that regard just yet.
    backend has now legacy JDBC functionality, is currently adapting to hibernate framework.
        users and admin models done, requests model is work in progress.

Project so far: most of the backend is set up, need to configure JDBC and Driver since I was expecting us to use Hibernate
    -still need to write/refactor service layers and repositories to match each other/models
    -frontend skeleton is set up, need to write html and styling before writing JS.
