    Front end foundation is pretty solid, needs to add javascript functionality for linkage, not tottaly confident in that regard just yet.
    backend has now legacy JDBC functionality, is currently adapting to hibernate framework.
        users and admin models done, requests model is work in progress.

Project so far: most of the backend is set up, need to configure JDBC and Driver since I was expecting us to use Hibernate
    -still need to write/refactor service layers and repositories to match each other/models
    -frontend skeleton is set up, need to write html and styling before writing JS.

    Have html and css mostly done, need to start working on funtionality with JS. 
    Have most file for each layer and code for some funtinality such as adding an employee and getting all employees, was able to use post to login but having trouble with get         method.

   Project Status: Front-end templates are looking pretty good. Completed lot of functions on DAO layer using JDBC and Postgres.
   - I will be working more with javascript to make api calls and manipulate DOM.
