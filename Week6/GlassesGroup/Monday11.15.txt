**Having issues with my gitHub when I try to push. Thought I fixed it.
We did a mock interview, I wish I had better notes for that because I listed the question and response for every person.
Some questions were on core Java(pillars of OOP, Java defninition, constructors), others were from last week's lessons(HTML, CSS, DOM).
I lost all the notes when I pushed the blank document without saving and closed the notepad. I am used to nano-ing on gitbash
instead where it reminds me to save. I apologize.
What I do know is that everyone was professional and it was helpful to see areas that may be lacking. Everyone was able to chime in
to assist the interviewee on keywords that may have been missed.
