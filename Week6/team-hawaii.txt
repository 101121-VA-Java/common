Mock interviews
	Interviewee: Albert
	Interviewer: Bruno
	Q1: What are the new features of ES6?
	Var, but now you have let and const, which are both block and or function scoped
	Q2: What is bubbling and capturing and what are the differences?
    Bubbling is when an event in the DOM bubbles or travels from the innermost child all the way up to the parent element. Capturing goes the other way around from outermost to innermost.
	Q3: Explain what strict mode does.
    One of the key features of “use strict”; is that you can no longer use variable or function hoisting.

    Interviewee: Bruno
	Interviewer: Kendrick
	Q1: What is AJAX and why do we use it?
	AJAX is asynchronous javascript and for http requests mostly.
	Q2: What are callback functions? What about self invoking functions?
    Not sure. Talked about it with everyone. Callback functions are where you can pass a function into another function, and self invoking are where the functions are invoked with parenthesis.
	Q3: What are javascript objects? How do you create them?
    Not sure. Bezza: JavaScript objects are created with {} and key value pairs. Arrays use square brackets.

	Interviewee: Kendrick
	Interviewer: Bezza
	Q1: What is the difference between undefined and null?
    Good question. Null is a primitive data type. Undefined is a number that doesn’t equal a value. You got me. Bezza: Undefined is the default value of a variable that is declared but not assigned. 
	Q2: What are the important HTTP verbs and what do they do?
	GET is like select from a table therefore it retrieves information
    POST is like inserting into a table so sending information and creating something in the table
    DELETE
    UPDATE
	Q3: List the levels of HTTP status codes and what they mean.
	0 is unsent
	4 is done
	100 is informational
	200 are successful
    300 are redirection
    400 are client error
    500 are server errors
    
	Interviewee: Bezza
	Interviewer: Albert
    Q1: What is the DOM? Is there a specific data structure that the DOM uses? What object in a browser allows us to interact with the DOM?
    Document object model in which html elements are structured hierarchically for javascript to manipulate. Tree. Document.
	Q2: Explain how the guard and default operators work.
    AND and OR operators. When the first part of the comparison is true the AND operator will have to check the second and return the second object if both elements are true.
    Once the first element is true, it doesn’t bother about the second element; it would return the first element. newObj = newObj || {}
    Q3: What is JSON? Is it different from JS objects?
    JSON is javascript object notation which is a lightweight javascript interchange method.
    JSON is based on JS objects as the name indicates so the only difference is JS objects the key should be a string but in JS the key doesn’t have to be a string.
