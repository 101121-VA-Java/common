Group to do list 
 1. Don't forget about portfolio on rev pro Due the 17th add P1 to portfolio
 2. Figure out how to show our tables on the front end. 
 4. Find out how to display different pages with the same tag. 
 5. Make sure our many to many relationship is set up correctly (may need to split our many
     to many table into two tables) check documentation and Kevins example for help. 
 6. Find out if we need to add anything to the smoothies, user and ingredient objects in order to add 
	pictures.
 7. Figure out how to display ingredients with an ngFor.
 8. Figure out how to make a smoothie by clicking on a bunch of ingredients.
 9. Make a list that saves the amount of ingredients that we will use. Or find some other way to do 
	it
10. Find out how to add Admin to the prod environment.  
11. Potentially use components to split up our pages so that we can reuse functionality in other 
	places.
12. Do mock interviews on java and SQL.
