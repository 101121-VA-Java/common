Hannah
- What did I do yesterday
Delveloped html pages for the entire front-end and started linking to my backend one by one.
- What am I working on today				
Continue to connect front to back page by page and functionality by functionality. 		
- Do I have any blockers				
I honestly like front end a whole lot less than back-end. I want to hang out back there. Which was a surprise.
