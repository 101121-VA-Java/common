Question # 1 : What can you tell me about encapsulation?
Answer: encapsulation is where you set the objects to private or protected so that 
you cant use them outside of their class or subclasses so you have to use getters and setters to access them.  1/1

Question # 2 : How do you create an Object?
Answers: in java you create a new object by using the new keyword, ex if its a string you
initilize it with String word = new String.  1/1
